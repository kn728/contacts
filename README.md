Hello this is a simple application you may use to search and view information about various contacts.
I developed this in Node v16.15. To download and use this source code on your own pc simply:
1. Download the folder.
2. Ensure Node.js and npm is installed.
3. open a cmd, and cd to the folder 'contacts'.
4. type in cmd 'npm install' to update node_modules.
5. type in cmd 'npm start'
   - if any module may still be missing, it will list as an error, and that case simply type in cmd 'npm install <missing_module>'. replace <missing_module> with the module name listed in the error. Repeat step 5.
